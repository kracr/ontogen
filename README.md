## Introduction

OntoGen is a configurable ontology generator designed to facilitate the creation of OWL 2 ontologies tailored to specific research needs. With a user-friendly interface and powerful backend capabilities, OntoGen allows users to generate custom ontologies based on selected OWL 2 constructs and profiles. It supports flexible configurations and provides options for both static and dynamic ontology generation, making it an ideal tool for benchmarking, performance evaluation, and ontology modeling research.
